# FM receiver without graphical user interface
Python 2.7 FM radio receiver program is presented here.  
I have used **HackRF** SDR in my tests, but it should correctly work with anoyher SDRs, supported by **osmosdr** library.  
You don't should have installed QT4 to run this program.  
To start it, just enter `./fm_receiver_without_gui` in your terminal.  
GNU Radio packages should be installed to your Linux OS.
